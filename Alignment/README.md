# Alignment and Superimposition
## Notes
* Superimposition can only be done when the two chains that are superimposed are exactly the same size. 
In most cases this will be the case since they should be the same chain but a condition should be added to check for length (and only align the first n atoms)
* Alignment does not work for dna (library used only does polypeptide alignments)
* Superimposition of two homodimers has to be implemented
